# ADHD-Control-Classification

The project classifies ADHD children and control children based on the EEG recordings. Supervised and unsupervised learning approaches were used to perform the classification.
Steps involved: 
1. Data preprocessing
2. Visualisation and Analysis (Topographic maps)
3. Modelling
  Supervised Approaches: 
    3.1.1. Perceptron    (Accuracy: 45.94%)
    3.1.2. Logistic Regression   (Accuracy: 70.27%)
    3.1.3. KNN   (Accuracy: 62.16%)
    3.1.4. Naive Bayes  (Accuracy: 59.45%)
    3.1.5. Decision Trees  (Accuracy: 54.05%)
    3.1.6. Random Forests (Accuracy: 59.45%)
    3.1.6. SVM   (Accuracy: 78.37%)
  Unsupervised approaches:
    3.2.1. Dimensionality reduction (PCA)
    3.2.2. K-means  (Accuracy: 54.05%)
4. Evaluation metrics
